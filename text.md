Hi everyone, in the recent years many decentralized web initiatives have been developed. One of their objectives is to give control or sovereignty over the data to the users. In more concrete making them control where they store their data and who has access to it.

But we can wonder if it is enough because other problems are related to the centralization of the web. 
For instance, divergence in interest between what is published and the user population for example in topics presented, design choices and languages.
Utilization of users as a source of unpaid sources revenue even when the data is anonymized or the contribution to the centralization of wealth.

One thing we could consider in those efforts is to give a more democratic control over their social application and a structural way to achieve it is to make them provide the computational power for the functioning of the app.

A structured decentralized linked data environment is a decentralized environment . Where we can consider "additional structural properties [along with the linked data principals] that allow us to make additional assumptions about data, documents, and their organization during query execution."

Examples of specification providing structure

    Linked Data Platform (LDP)
    Type Indexes
    WebID

Concretely we can use it as an incomplete map of where to query and has  a way to discriminate resources based on our queries.
